Are the Signs Really There?: First come ASL, then comes English [This title is descriptive, but could be more "interesting" or "catchy" for a pop science article. Maybe something that hints at the brain or language processing more directly.]

Have you ever wondered what it is like for deaf people to read English? Do they
say the words in their head? Do they sign in their head? After decades of trying to figure
out whether or not deaf readers translate English to ASL, research has been done to
determine and figure out the answer to these questions. ASL, as many of us know, is the
abbreviation for American Sign Language. It is a very unique and interesting way of
communicating without having to use any words to formulate conversations and
statements. Interesting enough as it is to think about, authors Morford, Wilkinson,
Villwock, Piñar, and Kroll, have investigated and conducted an experiment to find
results to whether or not English is translated to ASL while reading. [This paragraph raises interest and provides background on ASL. It sets up the research question well. It could perhaps connect more explicitly to "why this cognitive function (e.g., attention, memory, problem solving, etc.) is important in every day life" as per the rubric, beyond just "interesting to think about".]
Many deaf people use ASL as their first language, which we know is much more
complex than that of the English language. We can infer that English serves as a second
language in order to know what to sign and how to hold conversations using English
words. [This phrasing is informal; consider rephrasing as a direct statement or finding.] This is learned through reading and writing while ASL is learned through visuals.
In the article “When deaf signers read English: Do written words activate their sign
translations?” by Morford and friends, [Informal phrasing, consider "Morford and colleagues" or similar.] a study was conducted consisting of people who
were considered deaf ASL-English bilinguals. Provided were English words that
consisted of pairs that were either semantically related or semantically unrelated. An
example of semantically related words include “heart-brain” while semantically
unrelated words include “baby-lion”. Some of these pairs, semantically related or not,
shared related phonologic translations in ASL. This may cause some confusion if they
were to sign in their head while reading.

Participants were required to take a questionnaire and language proficiency
tasks. This consisted of them seeing two english words on a screen, lower case to be
exact, [Unnecessary detail.] one word before the other, and when the words were related they would have to
raise their dominant hand. If the words were unrelated, they would raise their
non-dominant hand. [The task itself (e.g., semantic judgment) needs to be clearer here. How does hand-raising relate to the core experiment?] Once the completion of the experiment was over, the participants
were required to translate the words from English to ASL. If the anticipated sign was not
executed, then that testing would be terminated. The study is designed to directly
answer the question posed in the title which is why even though the anticipated sign was
not executed, replies convenient with the metrics of the study were considered. [This sentence is a bit unclear and could be simplified for a general audience. Clarify the connection between the initial task and the later translation task.]
The results of the study may satisfy what everyone might’ve been thinking. [Informal phrasing.]
Connecting semantics and phonology, this resulted in the connection of ASL and the
relation of semantics. [This phrasing is convoluted. Clearly state the finding about the interaction between semantic relatedness and phonological relatedness in ASL translations.] This means that the deaf people in the study were more likely to
respond to the english word pairs that were semantically related and phonologically
related ASL translations rather than unrelated. The slower the participants responded to
the pairs, the more inaccurate the responses were. In the end, it was discovered that
ASL-English bilingual speakers do in fact sign while reading english words in order to
understand the meanings of them. 
Another experiment was conducted using hearing bilingual individuals without
the ASL proficiency test of course. Findings were similar and different when it came to
semantics and phonology. In this experiment, individuals were also able to respond
faster to the semantically related word pairs than the unrelated ones. However, even tho
they responded faster, they still managed to make more errors on the semantically and
phonologically related word pairs. It is interesting that this was the case even have had
no interaction of semantics and phonology. [This sentence has a grammatical error and is unclear. Clarify the key difference in findings between the deaf and hearing groups regarding the phonological effect.] Conducting the experiments for both deaf

bilinguals and hearing bilinguals shows the accuracy, along with similarities and
differences, of how bilinguals view English words based on their first language.
Due to the nature of this experiment, Morford and her colleagues were able to
report findings from the results. They say “Models of L2 lexical development suggest
that the translation equivalent may be important during early stages of L2 learning but
that skilled L2 users can access the meaning of L2 words without L1 mediation” This a [Grammatical error: "This *is* a very significant finding"] very significant finding because previously cross language activation was narrowed from
lexical forms like phonology and orthography. [This is a bit technical; simplify the explanation of its significance for a general audience.] The findings from this study indicate that
ASL was very significant in the English proficiency tasks even though the participants
were very fluent in English.
The results of this study are rather informative and interesting in their own way.
With deaf bilinguals being able to translate English words to ASL, people who don’t use
ASL may find it easier to communicate with those that do use ASL. Writing words down
for them to read and having them associate it with their language could provide more
community and inclusion. This would also be an opportunity for those that don’t use
ASL to learn how to do so. In writing this article, I encourage those that don’t use ASL to
learn the basics or get accustomed to the fact that there are people in the world who
don’t use words to speak but use signs. Even though they may be able to read and
understand what English speakers are putting out, it would be more helpful if they could
just read the signs. [The direct appeal/encouragement at the end shifts the tone from a pop science article to a more persuasive piece. Consider focusing more on the broader implications of the research findings rather than a direct call to action.]
